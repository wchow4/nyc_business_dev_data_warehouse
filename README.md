## Kimball Lifecycle Project Stages


### Project Planning
 
Motivation for project:
We are interested in the trend in frequency, type, and location of newly-created and existing businesses in New York City.


Description of the issues or opportunities the project will address:
Businesses come and go. The opportunity in understanding the trends in the type and location of new and existing businesses in New York City would allow the local government to better direct public resources in promoting commercial growth.
We can also gauge the frequency at which businesses open so that the city government can promptly allocate resources to attract foot traffic to those locations.


Project Business or Organization Value:
Clearly identifying the locations with frequent business openings and the types of businesses would allow the government to better spend on advertising, policing, and other economic incentives to attract customers to those enterprises and help advance the local economy.
The government will benefit from higher tax revenue and increased local employment by indirectly helping these businesses.
